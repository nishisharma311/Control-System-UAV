# Quadcopter Simulation
MATLAB SIMULINK

This project deals with the 3d simulation and implementation of control system of UAV on MATLAB Simulink to stablise the motion of quadcopter in unknown environment.


**PID Control for UAV**: We have used Software Method (PID Tuning Toolbox in MATLAB) which
is an efficient and consistent method that helps in automatically tuning PID
control gains to achieve the optimal system design.
